Welcome to LebronChat - The King's personal task management assistant! üëë

LebronChat is a basketball-themed chatbot inspired by LeBron James that helps you manage your daily tasks with the confidence and determination of a champion. Whether you're organizing your game plan, tracking deadlines, or planning events, the King has got your back!

## Adding todos

Create simple tasks without any specific deadlines. Perfect for general reminders and daily activities.

Example: `todo Practice free throws`

LebronChat will add the todo task to your list and confirm the addition with the King's signature style.

```
King James has added a new task:
[T][ ] Practice free throws
Now you have 1 tasks in the list
```

## Adding deadlines

Set tasks with specific due dates to keep you on track. The King knows that champions never miss their deadlines!

Example: `deadline Submit championship report /by 2024-12-31`

LebronChat will create a deadline task with the specified date and remind you that greatness requires meeting deadlines.

```
King James is setting a deadline!
[D][ ] Submit championship report (by: Dec 31, 2024)
Nothing easy! Deadline set!
```

## Adding events

Schedule events that span across multiple days or have specific start and end dates. Perfect for tournaments, training camps, or important meetings.

Example: `event NBA Finals /from 2024-06-06 /to 2024-06-18`

LebronChat will create an event with your specified date range and celebrate the addition.

```

## Viewing your task list

Example: `mark 1`

LebronChat will mark the specified task as completed and crown your achievement.

```

```

## Unmarking completed tasks

Sometimes you need to put a task back in play. No worries - even champions need to revisit their strategies.

Example: `unmark 1`

LebronChat will unmark the task and put it back in your active list.

```
This task is back in the game! Unmarked:
[T][ ] Practice free throws
```

## Deleting tasks

```

```

## Finding tasks

Search through your tasks using keywords. Perfect for when you have many tasks and need to find specific ones quickly.

LebronChat will display all tasks that contain your search keyword.

```
King James found these matching tasks:

[E][ ] Basketball tournament (from: Jun 1, 2024 to: Jun 3, 2024)
```

## Checking due tasks

Example: `due 2024-12-31` or `due` (for today's tasks)

LebronChat will show tasks due by your specified date, sorted chronologically.

```
